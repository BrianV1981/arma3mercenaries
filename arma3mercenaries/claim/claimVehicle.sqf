### Description

This script manages vehicle ownership, mobile respawn points, and additional actions for vehicles in Arma 3. It allows players to set mobile respawn points on vehicles, claim ownership if unowned, and perform other useful actions like flipping the vehicle or accessing a radio. The script is executed when a vehicle is initialized, typically via an event handler.

### Key Features:
1. **Set Mobile Respawn Point:**
   - The script adds a "Set Mobile Respawn" action to the vehicle, allowing players to create mobile respawn points.
   - A unique vehicle identifier is generated, and respawn points for West and Independent factions are assigned to the vehicle.
   - After setting the respawn points, the action is removed globally to avoid duplication.

2. **Ownership Check:**
   - A "Check if vehicle is owned" action is added to the vehicle.
   - If the vehicle is owned (`HG_Owner` variable present), the action is removed.
   - If the vehicle is unowned, a "Claim this vehicle" action is added, allowing players to claim ownership of the vehicle.
   - After claiming, ownership is assigned, and the vehicle is globally unlocked and managed by the new owner. ALiVE dynamic simulation is disabled for the claimed vehicle.

3. **Additional Actions:**
   - **Radio Access:** Adds an "arma3mercenaries Radio" action, allowing players to open a custom radio interface when near the vehicle.
   - **Flip Vehicle:** Adds a "Flip vehicle" action, enabling players to upright a flipped vehicle. This uses remote execution to ensure the action works on the machine where the vehicle is local.

### Post-Claim Actions:
- Once claimed, the vehicle is globally unlocked using `HG_fnc_lock`, ensuring that the new owner has full access. The vehicleâ€™s dynamic simulation is disabled to prevent it from being affected by ALiVE's systems.

This script offers a comprehensive solution for managing vehicle interactions, from mobile respawn points to ownership and additional utility actions in an Arma 3 scenario.
