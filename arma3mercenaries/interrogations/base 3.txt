    Description:
    This script allows a BLUFOR or Independent player to "interrogate" civilians within a 30-meter radius.
    The nearest player to the object with the addAction is identified and tagged with a temporary variable.
    Each civilian is assigned a unique variable and processed with a random health bleed between 1% and 50% damage.
    The health bleed ticks every 5 seconds until the civilian is dead, at which point the player receives
    a random financial reward between 10,000 and 50,000 credits. Dynamic feedback messages are provided
    to the player who triggered the action, using random war-like phrases with dynamic values.
