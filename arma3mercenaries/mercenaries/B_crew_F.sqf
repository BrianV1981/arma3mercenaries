# arma3mercenaries Blackfish Transport & Parachute Drop Script

## Overview
This script creates an immersive experience in which an armed Blackfish VTOL transports reinforcements to the player's position, accompanied by a radio notification and a crewed Blackfish flyover. Upon reaching the player's position, a parachute with an AI unit is dropped. The Blackfish proceeds beyond the player's position and is then deleted along with its crew to conserve resources.

## Features
- **Audio Notification:** The player is notified of the incoming reinforcement with sound effects.
- **Blackfish Flyover:** An armed Blackfish VTOL is created, manned with a pilot and gunners. It flies towards the player's position from a random starting point 1000 meters away.
- **Parachute Drop:** Once the Blackfish is close to the player, an AI unit is dropped via a steerable parachute.
- **Crew Management:** The Blackfish is manned by a pilot and three gunners, all properly assigned to turrets.
- **Destruction Management:** The Blackfish is indestructible until it reaches the player's location, at which point it becomes vulnerable. After completing its flyover, it and its crew are deleted.
- **Dynamic Simulation:** VCOM and ALiVE simulation are disabled for the Blackfish and its crew for smoother AI behavior.
- **Randomized Delays:** Both the audio notifications and transport arrival times are randomized for a more immersive experience.
- **Blocking Mechanism:** A 2-minute timer prevents the radio notifications from being spammed.

## Script Breakdown
1. **Audio Notification:**
   - Radio sounds are played to inform the player about the incoming Blackfish.
   - A random delay between 5 and 20 seconds is applied between the two radio notifications.
   - A random transport time between 60 and 120 seconds is applied to simulate realistic transport delays.

2. **Blackfish Creation:**
   - The Blackfish is spawned 1000 meters away from the player at a random direction.
   - The Blackfish is initially indestructible to prevent accidental damage.
   - A pilot and three gunners are created and assigned to their respective turrets.

3. **Waypoint Setup:**
   - The Blackfish flies over the player, with the first waypoint set to the player's position.
   - After reaching the player, the Blackfish continues to a second waypoint 2000 meters beyond the player.

4. **Parachute and Unit Drop:**
   - The Blackfish is monitored, and once within a distance of 100 to 150 meters, a steerable parachute is dropped from the Blackfish.
   - The parachute is moved to the Blackfish's position, simulating a realistic air drop.
   - An AI unit is placed inside the parachute, and it descends to the ground.

5. **Parachute Monitoring and Cleanup:**
   - The parachute's descent is monitored until it reaches the ground.
   - After the AI disembarks, the parachute is deleted.
   - Once the Blackfish passes the playerâ€™s position, it and the crew are deleted to save resources.

## Usage
- Place this script inside your ARMA 3 mission to simulate a Blackfish reinforcement transport and parachute drop.
- The script is optimized for dedicated servers and has been tested to function reliably in multiplayer environments.

## Requirements
- **ARMA 3**: This script is designed for ARMA 3.
- **ALiVE & VCOM AI** (optional): This script includes compatibility with ALiVE and VCOM AI but does not depend on them.
