Example 1: Basic Randomized Infantry and Vehicle Group
This example spawns a group with at least 3 mandatory units and a 50% chance of spawning additional units. It allows for up to 2 vehicles to be spawned.

Copy code
private _group = [
    _spawnPosition,       // Starting position of the group
    EAST,                 // CSAT faction
    ["O_Soldier_F", "O_Soldier_AR_F", "O_medic_F"], // Array of possible units
    [],                   // Relative positions (default)
    [],                   // Ranks (default)
    [],                   // Skill range (default)
    [],                   // Ammo range (default)
    [3, 0.5],             // Randomness control: 3 mandatory units, 50% chance for others
    0,                    // Azimuth (direction)
    true,                 // Precise position placement
    2                     // Max 2 vehicles
] call BIS_fnc_spawnGroup;
Example 2: More Complex Group with Vehicle Limit
This example introduces a mix of random infantry units and a vehicle with a 50% chance to spawn 3-10 units. It limits the group to spawning only 1 vehicle.

sqf
Copy code
private _group = [
    _spawnPosition,
    EAST,
    ["O_Soldier_TL_F", "O_Soldier_LAT_F", "O_Soldier_AR_F", "O_Soldier_exp_F"],
    [], 
    [], 
    [], 
    [], 
    [3, 0.5],           // 3 mandatory units, 50% chance for up to 10 units
    random 360,         // Random azimuth for direction
    true,               // Precise position placement
    1                   // Limit to 1 vehicle
] call BIS_fnc_spawnGroup;
Example 3: Fully Random Group with Random Vehicles
In this example, the function spawns a group with random units and random vehicles. The group has at least 2 units and a 70% chance of spawning up to 5 additional units. It also includes a maximum of 2 vehicles.

sqf
Copy code
private _group = [
    _spawnPosition,
    EAST,
    ["O_Soldier_F", "O_Soldier_LAT_F", "O_Soldier_GL_F", "O_Soldier_AR_F"],
    [], 
    [], 
    [], 
    [], 
    [2, 0.7],           // 2 mandatory units, 70% chance for up to 5 more units
    random 360,         // Random azimuth
    true,               // Precise position placement
    2                   // Max 2 vehicles
] call BIS_fnc_spawnGroup;
Example 4: Large Group with Higher Vehicle Limit
This example spawns a large group with a minimum of 5 mandatory units and a 30% chance to spawn additional units. It includes a higher vehicle limit of 3.

sqf
Copy code
private _group = [
    _spawnPosition,
    EAST,
    ["O_Soldier_A_F", "O_Soldier_AAR_F", "O_Soldier_SL_F", "O_Soldier_TL_F"],
    [], 
    [], 
    [], 
    [], 
    [5, 0.3],           // 5 mandatory units, 30% chance for others
    random 360,         // Random azimuth
    true,               // Precise position placement
    3                   // Max 3 vehicles
] call BIS_fnc_spawnGroup;
Notes:
minUnits specifies the minimum number of units that will always spawn.
chance determines the likelihood of spawning additional units beyond the minimum specified.
maxVehicles controls how many vehicles can spawn with the group. If set to a higher number, more vehicles will spawn, depending on the group composition.
