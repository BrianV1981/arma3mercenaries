<summary>Arma3Mercenaries Jukebox Music and Sounds Configuration</summary>

// File: arma3mercenaries/jukebox/arma3mercenaries_jukeboxSounds.hpp

## Overview

The Arma3Mercenaries Jukebox system uses two specific configuration files to manage music and sound settings efficiently. These files are included in the main mission configuration (`description.ext`) to maintain a clean and tidy structure, avoiding clutter from extensive music and sound class definitions.

- **`arma3mercenaries_jukeboxMusic.hpp`**: Contains the music tracks definitions used by the jukebox, detailing the sound files, tags, durations, and artist information for each track.
- **`arma3mercenaries_jukeboxSounds.hpp`**: Specifies additional sound configurations that are not classified as music tracks but are used in the jukebox system, ensuring all sound-related settings are centralized.

## Features

- **Organized Configuration**: By separating music and sound configurations into dedicated files, the `description.ext` remains organized and focused on broader mission settings.
- **Easy Maintenance**: Updates to music or sound settings are straightforward, as they are concentrated in these specific files, making maintenance and modifications easier.
- **Modular Design**: This structure supports modularity, allowing for easier integration or removal of the jukebox system from different missions without extensive changes to the main configuration file.

## How to Use

### Including in `description.ext`

To utilize these configuration files within your mission, include them in your `description.ext` like so:

class CfgMusic {
    #include "arma3mercenaries/jukebox/arma3mercenaries_jukeboxMusic.hpp"
};

class CfgSounds {
    #include "arma3mercenaries/jukebox/arma3mercenaries_jukeboxSounds.hpp"
};

### Modifying Music and Sounds

- **Editing Music Tracks**: To change music tracks or their details (like duration or artist), modify the `arma3mercenaries_jukeboxMusic.hpp` file.
- **Updating Sounds**: For sound changes not covered by music tracks, adjust the `arma3mercenaries_jukeboxSounds.hpp` file.

## Important Notes

- **Centralized Configuration**: All music and sound settings related to the jukebox are centralized in these files, ensuring that the `description.ext` is not overloaded with extensive sound and music definitions.
- **Flexible Integration**: These files can be easily modified or replaced to suit the specific needs of different missions, enhancing the flexibility of the jukebox system.

## Warning: `sound[]` Conflicts

When defining multiple music tracks or sound effects, itâ€™s crucial to ensure that the `sound[]` arrays are properly configured to avoid conflicts:

- **Conflicting `sound[]` Definitions**: If different sounds or music tracks share similar `sound[]` definitions (such as identical file paths or incorrect tags), it can lead to conflicts where the wrong sound is played or the game fails to recognize the correct sound file.
- **Debugging Issues**: If you encounter issues where the wrong track is played or no sound is heard, double-check the `sound[]` definitions in both `arma3mercenaries_jukeboxMusic.hpp` and `arma3mercenaries_jukeboxSounds.hpp` to ensure they are unique and correctly configured.
- **Best Practices**: Always test sound and music configurations in a controlled environment before deploying them in a live mission to ensure no conflicts arise.
