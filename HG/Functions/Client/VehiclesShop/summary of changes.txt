## Critical Steps

We removed unnecessary parameters in the `fn_dialogOnLoadVehicles.sqf` file to ensure it worked correctly with the ACE Interaction menu. This was a critical step in making sure the shop list populated correctly and was accessible.

### 2. Grad Money Integration
Across all scripts, we replaced the original HG money-handling functions with Grad Money functions. This ensured consistency in how funds are checked, displayed, and deducted.

### 3. ACE Interaction Setup
We carefully adjusted the parameters and scripts to ensure that the vehicle shop could be accessed and interacted with through the ACE menu. This involved aligning the functions and parameters to work seamlessly within the ACE framework.

## Summary
By systematically updating each script to integrate Grad Money and adjusting the parameters for ACE Interaction, we successfully modernized the vehicle shop. This process ensured that all money-related functions worked correctly and that the shop was fully functional within the ACE Interaction menu. The final adjustments, especially the parameter changes, were key to making sure the vehicle list was populated and displayed as expected.
